# Chatterbox

This is a chat application for Android using Firebase and Android Studio. This application serves two purposes - 

1. Interacting with a Firebase Database from an Android application. Here, the chats initialted by the users are stored in the Firebase's real-time databse.
2. Using Firebase Authentication in an Android application to authenticate users. We are using four methods to login into the application. The user can choose any method to login.

The four methods of login are -
A. Email/Password login
B. Google login
C. Facebook login
D. Phone Number login

This application also illustrates the use of handling the events when user tries to login offline using the ConnectivityReceiver class.
